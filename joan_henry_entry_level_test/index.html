                you
                a backstage pass to my imagination.The best way to communicate is compatible. Compatible communication
                is
                listening with open ears
                and an open mind, and not being fearful or judgemental about what you're hearing. You gotta go through
                it to
                see there ain't nothing to it.Go with the feeling of the nature. Take it easy. Know why you're here. And
                remember to balance your
                internal energy with the environment.I wrestled a bear once. A 750lbs black bear.Did you feel that? Look
                at
                me - I'm not out of breath anymore! It's good to yell at people and tell people that you're from
                Tennesee,
                so that way you'll be
                safe.Did you feel that? Look at me - I'm not out of breath anymore!These kind of things only happen for
                the
                first time once.It's OK to get Rib-grease on your face, because you're allowing people to see that
                you're
                proud of these ribs.
                Have you urinated? Have you drained your bladder? Are you free? Because if you haven't it will only come
                out
                later. I'm giving you some information that your bodily fluids may penetrate your clothing fibre's
                without
                warning.
